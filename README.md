ChatGPT cooked this up in a Jiffy. Here's the prompt that I used:

"I need a step by step guide on creating my IOS application, from creating the project with XCode to uploading it to my github. Here is the functionality and features: 
the app is a simple addition calculator. It has 2 text boxes for users to input the 2 numbers they want summed. Then it has a text box that displays the answers. It also has a go button 
to add the input numbers and a clear button to reset the text boxes to blank. Blank inputs count as 0s and anything that is not a number results in an error saying "only numbers or blanks 
are accepted". "


Here is the IDE run view:
